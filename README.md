## Description 

Li-Ion batteries are increasingly being used due to sustainable development goals and the numerous benefits they provide compared to other battery technologies. Accurate prediction of State-of-Health (SOH) for Li-Ion batteries has become critically important, and data-driven online SOH prediction models offer an efficient approach to address this challenge.

**We propose a simple yet effective machine learning framework utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for SOH prediction, addressing the common issues of high complexity, low interpretability, and high training costs. Our GRU-based predictions demonstrate high accuracy with an average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.724%.**

## Key Features

- üîã **Battery Health Monitoring**: Advanced SOH prediction for Li-Ion batteries
- üß† **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of LSTM and GRU architectures
- üìä **High Accuracy**: Achieves 0.724% RMSE with GRU model
- üìà **Data-Driven Approach**: Utilizes real battery degradation data
- üöÄ **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and execution with Jupyter notebooks
- üìö **Well Documented**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.10** or higher
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**

## Getting Started

### Download the Dataset

This project uses the open source [Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset 1](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:03ba4b01-cfed-46d3-9b1a-7d4a7bdf6fac) [1].

> **Important**: These data are copyright (c) 2017, The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford, and the 'Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset 1' researchers. All rights reserved.

> The dataset is made available under the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) with individual contents licensed under the [Database Contents License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/).

**Steps to download:**

1. Visit the [dataset download page](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:03ba4b01-cfed-46d3-9b1a-7d4a7bdf6fac/files/m5ac36a1e2073852e4f1f7dee647909a7)
2. Download the file `Oxford_Battery_Degradation_Dataset_1.mat` (‚ö†Ô∏è **262MB file**)
3. Place the downloaded file in the `./datasets/` directory

üìù **Note**: The [dataset readme file](https://github.com/sileneer/NRP_2022_EEE12/blob/main/datasets/Readme.txt) contains detailed information about the data structure and format.

### Setup

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sileneer/NRP_2022_EEE12.git
   cd NRP_2022_EEE12
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

Once you have completed the setup and downloaded the dataset:

1. **Open the main notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
   - Open `main_torch.ipynb`

2. **Run the analysis:**
   - Execute cells sequentially to load data, train models, and generate predictions
   - The notebook includes both LSTM and GRU model implementations
   - Results and visualizations will be generated inline

3. **Model Training:**
   - The notebook automatically loads the Oxford dataset
   - Preprocessing steps include data normalization and sequence preparation
   - Both LSTM and GRU models are trained and compared
